# PeppyMeter plugin for Volumio

***(Still under development. Not yet finalized)***

Volumio plugin for installing the [PeppyMeter](https://github.com/project-owner/PeppyMeter) software VU meter, extended by [2aCD](https://github.com/2aCD-creator) to display now playing data.

This plugin does not install [Peppy ALSA](https://github.com/project-owner/peppyalsa), which is required for providing visualizer data to PeppyMeter. To do so, you may install the companion plugin [Peppy ALSA Pipe](https://github.com/patrickkfkan/volumio-peppy-alsa-pipe).

This project was derived from the following projects:

- [PeppyMeter](https://github.com/project-owner/PeppyMeter): a software VU meter that displays audio visualizer data provided by [Peppy ALSA](https://github.com/project-owner/peppyalsa).
- [PeppyMeter Screensaver by 2aCD](https://github.com/2aCD-creator/volumio-plugins/tree/gh-pages/plugins/miscellanea/peppy_screensaver): a Volumio plugin that installs both Peppy ALSA and PeppyMeter on Volumio, and extends the latter to display now playing data.

Much of the Python code in this project was taken from the above projects, with some minor modifications here and there. Credit is given to the authors of those projects.
