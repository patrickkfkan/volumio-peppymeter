* Refactored the algorithms for circular and linear meters 
* The changes allow to create vertical linear and  circular meters
* The circular meter range can be more than 180 degrees now
* Fixed rendering issues for several default meters

## Renoir Edition 2021.07.17

* PeppyMeter can send HTTP requests with volume data to remote web servers
* PeppyMeter can receive HTTP requests and display volume data from those requests

## Michelangelo Edition 2016.09.05

PeppyMeter is a software VU Meter written in Python. It was originally developped as the new 'VU Meter' screensaver for [Peppy Player](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy.doc/wiki). With minor modifications it became a stand-alone application.
PeppyMeter gets audio data from media players (e.g. mpd) via fifo and displays current volume level in a Graphical User Interface
 in a form of traditional VU Meter.
